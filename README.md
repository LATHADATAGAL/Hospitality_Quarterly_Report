# Hospitality_Quarterly_Report
Enhancing Market Competitiveness through Business and Data Intelligence. A Project Inspired from codebasics.
# The Problem Statement
AtliQ Grands owns multiple five-star hotels across India. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.

Their revenue management team had hired a 3rd party service provider to provide them with insights from their historical data.
# The Key Metrics to track
RevPAR(Revenue generated per available room(both booked and non booked))<br>
**Occupancy** means how many rooms are occupied among all the available rooms.<br>
**ADR(Average Daily Rate)** is the measure of average paid for rooms sold in a given time, it also tells how the pricing of a hotel room is<br>
**DSRN(Daily Sellable Room Nights)** This metric tells us on an average how many rooms are ready to sell for a day<br>
**DBRN(Daily Booked Room Nights)** This metric tells us how many rooms are booked per night. Also includes cancellation & no show measures<br>
**Cancellation** means the customers who canceled their bookings and got a refund of 40%<br>
**No Show** means the customers who neither canceled their bookings nor showed up<br>
**DURN(Daily Utilized Room Nights)** This metric tells us how many rooms are utilized per night<br>
**Realization** tells about how many rooms were actually utilized among booked rooms and many more.<br>

# Key Takeaways <br>
1.The weekend and Weekday pricing of the hotel chain does not have much variance. It will be a great opportunity if they implement dynamic pricing for weekday and weekend<br>
2. The lowest occupancy property has lowest rating. Review the ratings and understand which services pulling down the rating and make corrective actions<br>
3. By following Pareto Principle (80% of pblm 20% hotel or 20% of effect will give 80% of benefits) we can gain back the market position
